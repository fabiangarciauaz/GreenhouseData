## Data acquisition
A weather station collected the data from a greenhouse with a curved roof. This type of greenhouse is for traditional use with no climate control and has natural ventilation. The greenhouse has an area of 165m2, 27.5m long, 6m wide. This is located in South Mezquitera, Juchipila, Zacatecas, Mexico, with latitude and longitude (21.42624033959812, -103.10935313358475) and orientation 21°25'34.5"N 103°06'33.8"W.

Inside and outside the greenhouse are nine sensors as a part of the Davis Vantage Pro 2 central weather system. Seven sensors outside the greenhouse measure temperature, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed, and direction. Inside the greenhouse, there are sensors for humidity and temperature. These sensors work together to create a uniform system within the greenhouse. 

Data were collected from July 12, 2020, to June 24, 2021, with sampling at 5-minute intervals.
